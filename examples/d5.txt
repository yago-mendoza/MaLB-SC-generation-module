.description
Design a smart contract to manage multiple subscription levels where fans pay a monthly fee in tokens to access exclusive content. Subscription levels include Basic (10 tokens/month), Premium (50 tokens/month), and Elite (100 tokens/month). Automatically deduct fees from a user's token balance every 30 days. If there are insufficient funds, the subscription is paused. Implement auto-renewal features, and if a subscription expires, access to exclusive content is immediately revoked until renewal.
