Referrer’s ID, referred friend’s account creation and ticket purchase status.
..constraints
Referrals must be confirmed by both account creation and an event ticket purchase by the referred friend.
..output
Incremented referral count for the referrer upon successful referral confirmation.
..primary_scenario
A referred friend creates an account and purchases a ticket, successfully confirming a referral and increasing the referrer's count.
..alternative_scenario
A referred friend creates an account but does not purchase a ticket, resulting in an unsuccessful referral that does not increase the count.

..output
Tokens awarded to referrers upon reaching specific referral milestones.
..primary_scenario

A referred friend successfully refers another person who creates an account and purchases a ticket, triggering a second-level reward for the original referrer.
