.description
Design a smart contract that tracks and rates fan interactions for each content piece. Fans earn points that influence their ranking on the platform, with interactions categorized as likes, comments, shares, and views. Each interaction type carries different weightings (1 point for likes, 10 points for shares, 20 points for comments). Fans can earn a maximum of 100 points per day from each activity. Platinum and Gold tier members can earn up to 150 and 200 points, respectively, but the extra points expire after a week.

Interaction Tracking and Rating
..scope
Tracking and rating fan interactions with content pieces using a smart contract. Interactions include likes, comments, shares, and views, each contributing differently to a fan’s overall points and ranking on the platform.
..input
Type of interaction (like, comment, share, view), fan’s interaction details.
..constraints
Interactions are quantified with specific points: 1 point for likes, 10 for shares, 20 for comments.
..output
Updated points and ranking for the fan based on their interactions.
..primary_scenario
Fan interacts with a content piece (e.g., likes it), and points are added to their total score.
..alternative_scenario
Fan reaches the daily point limit from a specific interaction type; further points from that interaction type are not added until the next day.

REQ02

..name
Daily Point Limits
..scope
Enforcing a maximum point limit that a fan can earn per day from each type of interaction to prevent point inflation and ensure equitable ranking.
..input
Fan’s daily interaction count, type of interaction.
..constraints
Standard limit is 100 points per day per activity. Adjusted limits for Platinum (150 points) and Gold (200 points) tier members, with expiration rules for extra points.
..output
Total points earned by the fan for the day, considering the daily limits.
..primary_scenario
Fan earns points up to the daily limit for an interaction type.
..alternative_scenario
Fan exceeds the daily point limit for an interaction type; excess points are not counted.

REQ03

..name
Tier-Based Point Adjustment
..scope
Adjusting daily point limits based on membership tier (Platinum and Gold), with special rules for the expiration of extra points earned beyond the standard limit.
..input
Fan’s membership tier, points earned from interactions, date of points earning.
..constraints
Platinum members can earn up to 150 points, and Gold members up to 200 points per activity, but extra points expire after one week.
..output
Adjusted and valid points based on tier and expiration of extra points.
..primary_scenario
Platinum or Gold tier fan earns points exceeding the standard limit, and the system tracks the expiration of these points.
..alternative_scenario
Extra points expire after a week, reducing the fan’s total points if they were not utilized within that timeframe.
