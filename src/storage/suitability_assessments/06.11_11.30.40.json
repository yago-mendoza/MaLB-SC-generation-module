The rules for ticket purchase, including allowing only one ticket per user and up to three tickets for Golden status users, are clearly specified in the `purchaseTicket()` function. The code utilizes `require` statements to enforce these limitations and ensure that users cannot exceed the allowed ticket purchase limits.\n\nFurthermore, the code distinguishes between regular users and Golden status users, providing additional ticket purchase privileges for the latter. This differentiation is crucial for creating a tiered system that incentivizes users to upgrade their status and participate in the event.\n\nOverall, the implementation of ticket purchase limitations in the code appears robust and effectively manages user interactions within the ticket sale system. By enforcing these restrictions, the smart contract can maintain fair and organized ticket distribution while catering to the needs of different user categories.",
