"The smart contract manages the sale of 50,000 tokens, each representing a ticket to a concert. Users can purchase one ticket each, but Golden status users can buy up to three tickets and transfer them to others. There is no limit on the number of Golden status users who can purchase multiple tickets. Transfers between users are facilitated through a secure online platform using unique ticket identifiers. If all 50,000 tokens are sold before the first 5-minute phase ends, the second phase begins immediately. Non-Golden users cannot participate in the second phase if tickets remain. Golden ticket holders have no set deadline to transfer tickets, but transfers must occur before the concert. Compensation for a canceled event is automatically calculated, with Golden ticket holders receiving an extra 25%, Platinum 5%, and Bronze none. Refunds and extra compensation for Golden and Platinum ticket holders are processed separately in a single transaction triggered by the official cancellation announcement. Any unsold tickets after both sales phases are returned to the issuer for potential recycling or re-release. Price caps and transaction monitoring prevent ticket re-sales at inflated prices."
