"This smart contract is designed to facilitate an auction of limited VIP tickets for a concert, with each ticket represented as a unique token. Each address is limited to placing a maximum of 3 bids, each of which must be at least 5% higher than the current highest bid. In the event that a new highest bid is placed within the last 5 minutes of the auction, an auction extension of 10 minutes is automatically triggered to prevent bid sniping. Bids placed are final and cannot be retracted or modified to ensure the integrity of the auction. Real-time updates of the highest bid are broadcasted through the emission of an event (NewHighestBid). The auction concludes when the time limit expires, with the highest bid at the end being the winning bid, determined by the first bid received with the highest amount in case of multiple bids with the same amount. When a bidder places a bid, they send the bid amount to the smart contract using the msg.value attribute. The contract holds the Ether until the auction concludes. Upon winning, the highest bid amount is automatically locked in the contract and can be transferred to the auction organizer by calling a withdraw"
